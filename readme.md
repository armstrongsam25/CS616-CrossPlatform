# Skywalk - Pedestrian Routing Application

## Vision Statement
For pedestrians, mainly student commuters in campus, who are seeking a safe, reliable path to their desired destinations, Skywalk is a pedestrian routing application that ensures users are guided along the safest and most convenient routes. Unlike Google Maps or Apple Maps, our product specializes in pedestrian-specific navigation, prioritizing safety and ease of travel.
